**THE HAIGHPATH** is a learning path designed to help you upskill as an AI/ML Engineer. Its goal is to equip learners with **mid-level** technical expertise in AI/ML system design and engineering by building AI/ML systems. It is paired with [THE HAIGHWAY](https://github.com/THEHAIGHWAY), another learning path which aims to cover **senior-** and **staff-level** technical skills in AI/ML System Design & Engineering.

The path combines both free and paid resources.
- **Free resources** include [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/THEHAIGHPATH), a [Substack newsletter](https://thehaighpath.substack.com/) and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@THEHAIGHPATH).
- **Paid resources** are offered through a learning platform by **ECHAILON**.

The learning path is organized into two streams:
- [**The Mainpath**](#the-mainpath): our structured core in AI/ML system design and engineering.
- [**The Bypaths**](#the-bypaths): specialized routes that extend and enrich the journey.
